Description: Regime shifts are abrupt changes in complex systems that are
    hard to predict, but their approach might be signaled by changes in the
    characteristics of the system's dynamical behavior. However, these statistics
    might be sensitive to the time scale of the observations from which they are
    calculated. This pacakge uses a data set of high-frequency observations made
    during an experimentally-induced regime shift (algal bloom in a lake) to
    explore the sensitivity of these statistics to the time scale of observation. This sensitivity is also explored using ecological simulations.
    Furthermore, the analysis seeks to find an approach to calculating these
    statistics that will provide a warning that is robust to time scale, either by
    identifying a reliable time scale or by using a statistic that is generically
    robust.
